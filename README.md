### Tracking
1. [Poke Vision: Find nearby pokemon on a map.](https://pokevision.com/)
2. [PokemonGo-DesktopMap: Like Poke Vision, but you use your own api keys, so there are less restrictions.](https://github.com/mchristopher/PokemonGo-DesktopMap)
3. [PokeScanner (android only)](https://github.com/BrianEstrada/PokeScanner) Android app which scans the area near you for pokemon. Like pokevision in app form. Don't use your main account to sign in.

### Bots
I don't condone bots, but they exist, and could be fun to play with. If you use your own account, there is a good chance you will be **banned**.
